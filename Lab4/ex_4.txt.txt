Exercise 4:
The algorithm implemented for this exercise is the Bellman-ford algorithm. This algorithm is implemented
in the file GraphAlgorithms.c and GraphAlgorithms.h. 

To test this implementation I created two graphs and ran Bellman-Ford on them. I created two arrays that
contain the correct result of the shortest path (g1Result and g2Result). After that I set a flag named failed to 0.
After this I loop through the graphs and check if the value on the vertices distance is the same as the value as
the array. If it is, nothing happens. If it isn't, the flag will change to 1 and the test will fail.

To run a different test you create a different graph in the function TestExercise4() and change the resultarray to 
the result you expect to get when you get the shortest path and run the same for-loop as shown in the function.
