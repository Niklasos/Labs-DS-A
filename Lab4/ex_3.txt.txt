Exercise 3:
The algorithms implemented in this exercise is implemented in the file GraphAlgorithms.c and GraphAlgorithms.h. The
algorithm I used to find the SCC of a graph is Depth-first search.

To test this implementation I created a graph with 4 SCC. After this I compared that the vertices that should be in 
the same SCC had the same number on the attribute SCCNumber in the vertex. If they have the same number, the test has run
successfully.

To verify this with another graph you can change the function TestExercise3() in the file Tests.c and change the if-
statement to the expected outcome of the new graph.
