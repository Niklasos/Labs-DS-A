Exercise 1.
The sorting algorithm with quadratic complexity is implemented in the file Exercise1.c. 
The algorithm implemented is insertion sort with an avarage complexity of Î˜(n^2).

I tested this implementation in the file Exercise4.c by creating a two dimensional array that contained the lists from Lab 1
and my personal number. I also created an array with these numbers sorted order so I could compare these two arrays. 
I ran InsertionSort on the unsorted list. After that compared these two arrays using two for loops. If any of these 
arrays dont match the sorted array I use a variable as a flag that changes to 0 and the test function print out a 
message that the Insertion sort failed.

To test this implementation with some other data you can either manipulate the numbers in the file Exercise4.c or create an
array and use the function InsertionSort(int * arr, int elements) and enter the array that you want to sort together 
with the number of elements in the array.
