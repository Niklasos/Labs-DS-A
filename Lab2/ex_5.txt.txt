Exercise 5:
The file that implements the testing is in the file Exercise5.c.

I loaded arrays using the load_file function. Then I ran the InsertionSort on one of the arrays and MergeSort on the other. After this I 
created a for-loop that print out all the numbers in sorted order. 

I tested this implementation by using a flag in the for-loop that is changed to 0 if one of the lists doesnt match the sorted list and print
out an error message.

The difference between the two algorithms is getting more significant the bigger the list is getting. The insertion sort is suffering more
from a bigger list.
