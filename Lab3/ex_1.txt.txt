Exercise 1.
The file BinarySearchTree.c implements the data structures and the functions.

To test the implementation I created three functions: TestMinMax() that tests the functions TreeMinimum and TreeMaximum
, TestSucPre() that tests the functions TreeSuccessor and TreePredecessor, and TestDepthAndCount() that tests the 
functions TreeDepth and TreeCount. I did this by calling these functions and saving the result in a variable.
Then compared these variables with what the expected result is. If the tests run successfully the test functions return 1
otherwise they return 0. Then I have a function that is called RunTest() that prints out a positive message if they run
successfully and a negative message indicating which test failed. This way it is easier to understand what implementation 
didnt get the right result.

To execute your own test on this implementation you can use the Test.c class and change the variables to see if the test still
run successfully.
