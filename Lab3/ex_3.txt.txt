Exercise 3.
Testing of Lilian Sonestedt and Kevin Kaunisvaaras implementation.

To test the implementation I created three new functions: TestMinMax() that tests the functions Min and Max
these tests ran with an expected result. TestSucPre() that tests the functions Successor and Predecessor these functions returned expected resul.
TestDepthAndCount() that tests the functions Depth and Count these function also ran with an expected result.

The code is using names that refer to what the variables represent. Therefore, the implementation is easy to 
understand. The implementation is also structured in a good way that makes it easy to re-use the code implemented in this exercise.
