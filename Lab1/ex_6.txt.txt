Exercise 6.
Testing of Lilian Sonestedt and Kevin Kaunisvaaras implementation.

I ran a test on the queue. I enqueued a sequence of numbers: 5, 12, 8, 2, 7, 10, 90. Then I tried to dequeue these
numbers. The implementation ran without any problems and with an expected result.

The code is using names that refer to what the variables represent. Therefore, the implementation is easy to 
understand. The code uses “Magic numbers” when deciding the max size of the stack. This could be avoided by, 
for example, defining a constant. Besides this I think the code is written in a good way.
