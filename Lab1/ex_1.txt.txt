Exercise 1.

The file List.h implements the data structure for the doubly-linked list and the file List.c implements the algorithms. 

I tested the implementation in Exercise2.c. This was done by adding a set of numbers to the doubly-linked list.
Then I created a function that is called "RunTest" and it checks if any of the list functions don't get an exected
value. If it doesn't get an expected value it print out "Test exercise2 failed!" and if expected it prints out
"Test exercise2 success!!".

To test the implementation with a different set of numbers you can change the values in Exercise2.c functions called
"AddToList1" and "AddToList2". To get the predecessor and successor from nodes you can change the input parameters
in the function "RunTest".
