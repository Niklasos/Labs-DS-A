Exercise 4.

The file Queue.h implements the data structure for the stack and the file Queue.c implements the algorithms. 

I tested the implementation in Exercise5.c. This was done by adding a set of numbers to the queue. To test if the 
implementation is working I save the value from the "Dequeue" function in a variable and compares it to the expected result.
If all the values are correct we I print out "Queue test ran successfully!" otherwise we print "Queue test failed!".

To test the implementation with a different set of numbers you can change the values in Exercise5.c function called
"TestQueue".
