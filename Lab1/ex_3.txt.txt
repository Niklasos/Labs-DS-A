Exercise 3.

The file Stack.h implements the data structure for the stack and the file Stack.cimplements the algorithms. 

I tested the implementation in Exercise5.c. This was done by adding a set of numbers to the stack. To test if the 
implementation is working I save the value from the "Pop" function in a variable and compares it to the expected result.
If all the values are correct we I print out "Stack test ran successfully!" otherwise we print "Stack test failed!".

To test the implementation with a different set of numbers you can change the values in Exercise5.c function called
"TestStack".
