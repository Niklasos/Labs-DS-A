Exercise 2.

The test was done by adding a set of numbers to the doubly-linked list.
Then I created a function that is called "RunTest" and it checks if any of the list functions don't get an exected
value. If it doesn't get an expected value it print out "Test exercise2 failed!" and if expected it prints out
"Test exercise2 success!!".
