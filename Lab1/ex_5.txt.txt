Exercise 5.

The test of the stack was done by adding a set of numbers to the stack. To test if the 
implementation is working I save the value from the "Pop" function in a variable and compares it to the expected result.
If all the values are correct we I print out "Stack test ran successfully!" otherwise we print "Stack test failed!".

The test of the queue was done by adding a set of numbers to the queue. To test if the 
implementation is working I save the value from the "Dequeue" function in a variable and compares it to the expected result.
If all the values are correct we I print out "Queue test ran successfully!" otherwise we print "Queue test failed!".
